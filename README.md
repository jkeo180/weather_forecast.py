# weather_forecast.py

I made this weather forecast app in python to teach me more about weather apis and json
it works by inputing your data such as : Tampa,florida,Usa and it tells you all about the cloud conditions,latitude and longitude
 'feels like',ground level,humidity,pressure,sea level,temp,temp max and min
